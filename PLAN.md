# Plan — Spinrate Sales Penetration

**Tier:** Heavy
**Status:** Deployed to spinrate.lailarallc.com — production data synced, UI polish complete, compound pass pending

## Goal (2026-06-15)

Interactive penetration × velocity quadrant dashboard for the Lailara portfolio. Plots Cinderhaven SKUs by distribution (x) vs SPPD (y), bubble-sized by total dollars. Four required views: quadrant chart, quadrant migration, ranked expansion cases, ranked at-risk list. Guided narrative walks 5 protagonist SKUs through their strategic story, then hands the user full interactive controls. Deployed to a lailarallc.com subdomain. Part of a 5-tool suite with a planned pillar content piece. Audience is C-suite prospective clients — must be legible in 90 seconds without analyst background.

## Focus

All 8 units complete, code reviewed, production data synced with archetype variance, UI polish applied. Next: `/ce:compound`.
