# Plan — Spinrate Sales Penetration

**Tier:** Heavy
**Status:** Loading state + Performance Fix D deployed to production, prod outage (stale DB credential) fixed and verified live. `docs/AUDIT-2026-07-01.md` fully resolved across two concurrent sessions: Basic Auth added then reverted, Indexed SPPD benchmark fixed, quadrant median consistency, at-risk Level/Trend disclosure, ACV% clamp, quarter validation, test hardening, dependency pinning — plus (2026-07-02) the quadrant legend clipping bug root-caused and fixed (custom HTML/CSS legend replacing Plotly's native SVG legend), all chart legends standardized to bottom placement, and a shared `data_grid()` component rolled out to all three tables (no pagination, autosized columns, compact, full-width). 181 tests. Deployed and live. Compound pass pending.

## Goal (2026-06-15)

Interactive penetration × velocity quadrant dashboard for the Lailara portfolio. Plots Cinderhaven SKUs by distribution (x) vs SPPD (y), bubble-sized by total dollars. Four required views: quadrant chart, quadrant migration, ranked expansion cases, ranked at-risk list. Guided narrative walks 5 protagonist SKUs through their strategic story, then hands the user full interactive controls. Deployed to a lailarallc.com subdomain. Part of a 5-tool suite with a planned pillar content piece. Audience is C-suite prospective clients — must be legible in 90 seconds without analyst background.

## Focus

Loading state + audit remediation shipped. Run `/ce:compound`.

### Un-pinned defect — tests are waiting, fix is not written

Added 2026-07-28 by the FIX-LIST cross-repo test sweep. Strict-xfail tests
assert the corrected behaviour, so the suite fails loudly the moment the fix
lands and the marker has to come off. Do not remove a marker without doing the
fix.

- [ ] **Migration's two periods get identical distribution.** `app/db.py:316` —
      `get_distribution()` builds its WHERE clause from `retailers` and
      `region` only and hardcodes `fd.is_active = TRUE`. It selects
      `authorized_date` and `deauthorized_date` (`:332-333`) and never
      constrains on them, so every SKU carries the same ACV% in both periods
      and 8 of the 12 ordered quadrant transitions are unreachable.
      `is_active = TRUE` compounds it: a SKU deauthorized inside the window is
      dropped from both periods rather than shown as a delisting. Add a
      date-window clause. Tests: `tests/test_migration.py` —
      `test_query_constrains_on_the_authorization_window`,
      `test_query_does_not_hardcode_is_active`. The `two_period_metrics`
      fixture hands the same frame to both periods on purpose — it reproduces
      production; update it once the query is fixed.
      Consider hiding the Migration tab until this lands.
      Related, not fatal: `quadrant.py:693` and `expansion.py:110` also call
      `get_distribution(filters)`, so ACV% is inert to the date filter there
      too — defensible as a current-state reading on a snapshot tab.

## Migration distribution window (fixed and DB-verified 2026-07-28)

`get_distribution()` built its WHERE clause from `retailers` and `region` only
and hardcoded `fd.is_active = TRUE`, ignoring `start_quarter`/`end_quarter`.
Both of Migration's periods therefore received an identical frame: `acv_pct_p1`
equalled `acv_pct_p2` for every SKU, arrows were strictly vertical, the ACV term
in `magnitude` was permanently zero, and only Stars <-> Wide-but-Dead and Hidden
Gems <-> Question Marks were reachable -- 8 of 12 ordered transitions impossible.
The narrative printed the consequence in plain sight, rendering the same
distribution percentage twice in a sentence asserting movement.

Now filtered on the authorization window overlapping the period:
`authorized_date <= quarter_end AND (deauthorized_date IS NULL OR
deauthorized_date >= quarter_start)`. With no period supplied it falls back to
`is_active = TRUE`, so unfiltered callers are unchanged. `_cache_key` already
hashes every filter key, so the two periods get distinct cache entries.

Verified without a database by patching `_execute_query`: Q3 yields params
['2025-09-30','2025-07-01'] and Q4 ['2025-12-31','2025-10-01'], the no-period
path still emits `is_active = TRUE`, and the clause composes correctly with
retailer and region. `tests/test_db.py` passes 5/5 before and after. Seven
tests replace the two strict-xfails; the load-bearing one asserts that two
periods cannot produce the same parameters.

Verified against the live Postgres 2026-07-28 via `flyctl proxy`, read-only,
through the app's own `db.get_distribution()` rather than hand-written SQL:

| window | rows | SKUs with ACV% movement | exits | entries |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q3 2025 -> Q4 2025 (**shipped default**) | 9,164 -> 9,176 | **5 of 50** | 0 | 12 |
| Q3 2024 -> Q4 2024 | 9,223 -> 9,135 | — | 88 | 0 |
| Q2 2024 -> Q3 2024 | 9,404 -> 9,223 | **45 of 50** | 181 | 0 |

Q3 and Q4 2025 no longer return identical frames (`equals()` False). Delistings
surface correctly in any window that spans one.

**READ THIS BEFORE CONCLUDING THE FIX DIDN'T LAND.** The fix is verified in 2024
windows and *cannot be observed at the default period*, because the data has no
2025 deauthorizations. Do not read an unchanged Migration tab as evidence the
fix regressed or was reverted. At Q3->Q4 2025, ACV% moves at most 0.47pp,
crosses no median, and all six observed transitions are ones that were already
reachable under the bug (the within-ACV-side moves). The previously-impossible
class appears only in 2024 windows: `Wide but Dead -> Question Marks`, 3 SKUs,
a genuine ACV-median crossing.

Blast radius: nil at first load. With the shipped `DEFAULT_FILTER_STATE`
(Q1-Q4 2025), `get_distribution` returns a frame byte-identical to the old
`is_active = TRUE` snapshot -- 9,176 rows, `equals()` True. Quadrant and
Expansion are unchanged on open. They diverge only on a historical range
(Q1-Q4 2024: +464/-49 store-SKUs; 2023: +816/-49), which is correct behaviour.

### Open: the demo data has no 2025 deauthorizations (data gap, not code)

All 816 deauthorizations fall between 2023-04-18 and 2024-11-10;
`DEFAULT_FILTER_STATE` is Q1-Q4 2025. So the tab whose entire premise is "what
moved between these two periods" opens showing that essentially nothing moved:
45 of 50 arrows strictly vertical, zero exits, 0.47pp maximum ACV% move.

Before this fix the tab was confidently wrong. It is now correctly empty. Both
fail the same reader, and a prospect opening Spin Rate sees neither the
delisting story the tab was built to tell nor any reason to trust it. The
story exists only in a historical range nobody will select.

This is a data-generation gap and could not have been found from source review.
Two ways to close it:

- [ ] **Preferred:** extend deauthorizations into 2025 in the seed so a demo
      tool actually demonstrates. Touches canonical figures -- change protocol
      + canonical-figures impact check + Shawn's approval.
- [ ] Or move `DEFAULT_FILTER_STATE` to a window that has movement. Cheaper,
      but it makes the shipped default a historical period, which reads oddly
      on a tool presented as current-state.

Still open, unrelated to the above:

- [ ] `two_period_metrics` still hands one dist frame to both periods. A second
      frame would let migration mechanics be tested against real ACV% movement.
- [ ] The inner join at `app/views/migration.py:186` still drops entries and
      exits, so the 12 Q4-2025 entries above cannot appear as Sankey nodes yet.
      Separate [High]; the distribution window is a precondition for it, not a
      substitute.
